PROJECTS 

1\. AI-Powered Text-to-3D Generation Link 

• Constructed an AI system that transforms natural language into 3D models with over 90% accuracy 

using Open fabric SDK and local LLMs. 

• Orchestrated a two-stage generation pipeline that processed 50+ user prompts and converted text → 

image → 3D using DeepSeek/Llama via Hugging Face. 

• Programmed 5+ REST APIs using FastAPI for handling user prompts, backend processing, and asset 

storage. 

• Built a modular stub class to manage real-time app connections, handling 100+ WebSocket events 

efficiently. 

• Implemented persistent storage for 30+ generated assets and maintained prompt-history logs to 

support user memory and regeneration.
